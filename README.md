# Module_5 Challenge - Financial Planning Tools

Iâ€™ve decided to start a fintech consulting firm that focuses on projects to benefit local communities. I just won my first contract with a large credit union. The project entails building a tool to help credit union members evaluate their financial health. Specifically, the credit union board wants the members to be able to do two things. First, they should be able to assess their monthly budgets. Second, they should be able to forecast a reasonably effective retirement plan based on their current holdings of cryptocurrencies, stocks, and bonds. The chief technology officer (CTO) of the credit union wants me to develop a prototype application to present at its next assembly.  I'll be creating two financial analysis tools - one for emergencies, one for retirement.

## Technologies

This project leverages python 3.7.11 with the following packages:

* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) - Use the Pandas library, along with JupyterLab, to collect, prepare and analyze data.

* [os](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html) - This module provides a portable way of using operating system dependent funcionality.

* [json](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html) - Lightweight data interchange format.

* [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) - An elegant and simple HTTP library for Python.

* [dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) - Reads key-value pairs from a .env file and can set them as environment variables.

* [alpaca_trade_api](https://pypi.org/project/alpaca-trade-api/) - Allows rapid trading algo development easily.

* [MCForecastTools] - Runs Monte Carlo simulations on financial Pandas data frames.

* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) - For plotting the data on line graphs and box plots.

* [datetime] and [BDay] - Used to calculate the current date as well as the previous business day.  Rather than hardcoding dates during our data collection process, we'll use the most recent market close data.

## Installation Guide

Before running the application first import the following libraries:

```python
  import os
  import requests
  import json
  import pandas as pd
  from dotenv import load_dotenv
  import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi
  from MCForecastTools import MCSimulation

  %matplotlib inline

  import datetime
  from pandas.tseries.offsets import BDay
```

## Usage and Summary Analysis

The financial planner for emergencies will allow members to visualize their current savings and then determine if they have enough reserves for an emergency fund.

The financial planner for retirement will forecast the performance of their retirement portfolio for 30 years.  The tool will make an Alpaca API call via the Alpaca SDK to get historical price data for use in Monte Carlo simulations.
